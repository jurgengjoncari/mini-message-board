# Mini Message Board â€“ Frontend

The **Mini Message Board** is a simple web application that lets people share short messages in a chat-style interface.
I did this project to practice and showcase my skills in full stack JavaScript.
This is the frontend, where I used Angular and SCSS. Check out the [backend repository](https://github.com/jurgengjoncari/mini_message_board) for the server-side code.

## User Experience

- Everyone can read messages
- Only authenticated users can create messages
- Users can sign in using username and password
- Users can log out to end their session
- Real-time Messaging with auto-scroll
- Smooth Animations for loading and transitions

## User Interface

- Frosted glass effect for modern UI elements
- Loading Skeletons while fetching messages
- User avatars next to messages
- Message groups organized by date
- Safe area support for modern mobile devices
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessible design with high contrast colors

## Technical Implementation

- **Angular 20** with standalone components
- **TypeScript** with strict type checking
- Semantic **HTML** for accessibility
- **SASS** for modular styling
- Design tokens and variables for consistency
- Responsive units such as `rem`, `ch`, `dvh`, etc., for scalability
- Local storage based session management
