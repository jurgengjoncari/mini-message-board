# Mini Message Board ‚Äì Frontend

The **Mini Message Board** is a simple web application that lets people share short messages in a chat-style interface.
I did this project to practice and showcase my skills in full stack JavaScript. 
This is the frontend, where I used Angular and SCSS. 

## Overview

- Everyone can read messages.
- Only authenticated users can create messages.
